# Bleeter
**(Definitely not twitter)**

This is a project I've been working on since march 2022, i've been following the courses of [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) AKA @TraversyMedia, on how to build a MERN app from scratch, building the Rest API, using authentication, connecting it to a database, setting up the frontend and finally aplying redux and deploying the whole thing on Heroku.

## Description
Although the tutorial follows the creation of a 'Goal setting' app, I decided to take a different approach and see if i'm able to make some sort of social network (a twitter copycat basically), naming it 'Bleeter' as it sounds similar and it's the name of a GTA parody social network.

## Running it
At the moment, the whole thing is at a development stage. You can download the code if you want to!
